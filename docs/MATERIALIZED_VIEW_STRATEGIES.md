## Introduction

Materializing data can significantly improve query performance but comes with tradeoffs in terms of storage costs and data freshness. This document provides guidance on when and how to use materialized views for optimal performance.

## When to Use Materialized Views

Consider materializing data when:

1. **Frequent Access**: The data is queried frequently by multiple consumers
2. **Complex Transformations**: The transformation logic is complex and computationally expensive
3. **Stable Schemas**: The source and target schemas are relatively stable
4. **Aggregations**: The data involves aggregations across large datasets
5. **Common Data Model**: The data represents a standardized view used by multiple downstream processes

Avoid materializing when:

1. **Infrequent Access**: The data is rarely queried
2. **Simple Transformations**: The transformation logic is simple and performs well on-the-fly
3. **Rapidly Changing Data**: The source data changes frequently, requiring constant refreshes
4. **Exploratory Analysis**: The data is used primarily for ad-hoc exploration

## BigQuery Optimization Techniques

### Partitioning

Partition tables when:

- The data has a natural time-based dimension (date, timestamp)
- Queries frequently filter on this dimension
- The partitioned column has high cardinality but not too high (millions of values)

Example configuration in Dataform:

```javascript
config {
  type: "table",
  bigquery: {
    partitionBy: "DATE(timestamp_column)",
    requirePartitionFilter: true
  }
}
```

### Clustering

Cluster tables when:

- Queries frequently filter or aggregate on specific columns
- The clustered columns have high cardinality but not too high
- You need to optimize beyond partitioning

Example configuration in Dataform:

```javascript
config {
  type: "table",
  bigquery: {
    clusterBy: ["region", "product_category"]
  }
}
```

### Combined Approach

For optimal performance, consider combining partitioning and clustering:

```javascript
config {
  type: "table",
  bigquery: {
    partitionBy: "date_column",
    clusterBy: ["region", "customer_type"],
    requirePartitionFilter: true
  }
}
```

## Incremental Table Updates

Use incremental tables when:

1. **Large Datasets**: Processing the entire dataset is expensive
2. **Append-Only Data**: New data is primarily appended rather than updated
3. **Time-Based Processing**: Data can be processed based on a timestamp

Example configuration in Dataform:

```javascript
config {
  type: "incremental",
  uniqueKey: ["id"],
  bigquery: {
    partitionBy: "date_column",
    updatePartitionFilter: true
  }
}

// Only process new records
${when(incremental(), `WHERE timestamp_column > (SELECT MAX(timestamp_column) FROM ${self()})`)}
```

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor materialized view performance:

1. **Query Performance**: Track query execution time before and after materialization
2. **Refresh Costs**: Monitor the cost of refreshing materialized data
3. **Storage Impact**: Track the additional storage required
4. **Freshness SLAs**: Ensure data freshness meets business requirements

## Example Implementations

### Standard Materialized View

```sql
config {
  type: "table",
  bigquery: {
    partitionBy: "date",
    clusterBy: ["region"]
  }
}

SELECT
  date,
  region,
  SUM(sales) as total_sales,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_count
FROM ${ref("source_data")}
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

### Incremental Materialized View

```sql
config {
  type: "incremental",
  uniqueKey: ["date", "region"],
  bigquery: {
    partitionBy: "date",
    updatePartitionFilter: true
  }
}

SELECT
  date,
  region,
  SUM(sales) as total_sales,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_count
FROM ${ref("source_data")}
WHERE true
${when(incremental(), `AND date > (SELECT MAX(date) FROM ${self()})`)}
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

### Optimized Consumer Table

For standardized consumer data that's frequently accessed:

```sql
config {
  type: "table",
  bigquery: {
    partitionBy: "last_update_date",
    clusterBy: ["postal_code", "state_code"]
  }
}

SELECT
  customer_id,
  standardized_email,
  standardized_phone,
  standardized_name,
  standardized_address,
  postal_code,
  state_code,
  date_of_birth,
  last_update_date
FROM ${ref("standardized_consumer_data")}
```
