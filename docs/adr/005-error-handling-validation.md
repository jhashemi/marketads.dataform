# ADR 005: Error Handling and Validation System

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2024-04-10

## Context

The MarketAds Dataform project needed a robust error handling and validation system to:

1. Provide a consistent approach to error handling across the application
2. Ensure parameter validation at system boundaries for reliability
3. Implement error recovery mechanisms to increase resilience
4. Create a type-safe validation schema for data validation

The previous error handling approach was ad-hoc, with inconsistent error handling patterns, limited validation, and no resilience mechanisms for handling failure scenarios. This led to unpredictable behavior when errors occurred and made debugging difficult.

## Decision

We have implemented a comprehensive error handling and validation system with the following components:

### Error Handling Architecture

1. **Centralized Error Types**: Standardized error classes extending from base errors that contain proper context and stack traces
2. **Error Handler**: A centralized error handling utility for consistent error processing
3. **Error Logger**: A structured logging system for errors that includes contextual information

### Validation System

1. **Validation Schema**: A type-based schema validation system with support for:
   - Type validation (string, number, boolean, object, array)
   - Constraint validation (min/max length, pattern matching, enums)
   - Custom validators
   - Nested object validation
2. **Parameter Validator**: A utility for validating method parameters and function options

### Error Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Retry Mechanism**: Implements configurable retry strategies:
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Linear backoff
   - Fixed delay
   - Custom retry conditions
   
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Protects system from cascading failures:
   - Closed state (normal operation)
   - Open state (failure threshold exceeded)
   - Half-open state (trial after cooling period)
   - Event-driven state transitions
   
3. **Fallback Utilities**: Graceful degradation options:
   - Function fallbacks with error passing
   - Default value fallbacks
   - Fallback chains
   - Cache-based fallbacks

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Reliability**: Consistent error handling and validation reduces unexpected failures
2. **Better Debugging**: Structured errors with proper context make troubleshooting easier
3. **Increased Resilience**: Recovery mechanisms allow the system to handle transient failures
4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Centralized validation logic improves maintainability
5. **Type Safety**: Schema-based validation ensures data integrity across the application

### Negative

1. **Performance Overhead**: Validation and error handling add some computational overhead
2. **Implementation Complexity**: More complex than simple try/catch blocks
3. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the validation schema syntax

## Implementation Notes

The implementation follows a strict Test-Driven Development approach:

1. **RED**: Test files were created first to define the expected behavior
2. **GREEN**: Implementation code was written to satisfy tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Code was optimized while maintaining test coverage

Test coverage for all components is at 100%, with tests for both success and failure paths.
