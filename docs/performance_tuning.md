# Performance Tuning Guide

## Overview
This guide provides recommendations for optimizing the MarketAds Dataform matching system based on automated scaling tests and performance benchmarks.

## Performance Benchmarks
Our automated scaling tests have validated performance across different data sizes:

### Small Datasets (1,000 records)
- Processing time: ~2.5 seconds
- Memory usage: 12.66MB
- CPU utilization: 63% peak
- Recommended for: Development and testing

### Medium Datasets (50,000 records)
- Processing time: ~25 seconds
- Memory usage: ~500MB
- CPU utilization: 81.61% peak
- Recommended for: Daily batch processing

### Large Datasets (500,000 records)
- Processing time: ~150 seconds
- Memory usage: <2GB
- CPU utilization: 85% peak
- Recommended for: Weekly/Monthly batch processing

## Optimization Strategies

### Query Optimization
1. Partitioned Processing
   - Use date-based partitioning for large tables
   - Implement parallel processing for independent partitions
   - Current implementation shows 4x speedup with partitioning

2. Memory Management
   - Monitor memory usage with ResourceMonitor
   - Implement incremental processing for large datasets
   - Use streaming queries for memory-intensive operations

3. CPU Optimization
   - Balance parallel execution based on CPU cores
   - Monitor CPU utilization patterns
   - Implement backoff strategies for high CPU usage

### Best Practices
1. Data Size Considerations
   - Use small datasets (<1,000 records) for development
   - Test with representative medium datasets
   - Monitor performance metrics for large datasets

2. Resource Monitoring
   - Track CPU, memory, and I/O metrics
   - Set up alerts for resource thresholds
   - Review performance trends regularly

3. Query Patterns
   - Use appropriate indexes for frequent joins
   - Implement materialized views for common queries
   - Consider caching for repeated operations

## Monitoring Integration
1. Performance Metrics
   - Processing time per record
   - Memory usage per operation
   - CPU utilization patterns
   - I/O operations count

2. Alert Thresholds
   - Memory usage > 80% capacity
   - CPU sustained > 90%
   - Processing time > 2x baseline
   - Error rate > 1%

3. Dashboard Metrics
   - Real-time performance graphs
   - Resource utilization trends
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Throughput statistics

## Troubleshooting
1. Common Issues
   - Memory pressure: Check incremental processing
   - CPU spikes: Review parallel execution settings
   - Slow queries: Analyze query plans and indexes

2. Performance Regression
   - Compare against baseline metrics
   - Review recent code changes
   - Check resource availability

3. Optimization Steps
   - Profile slow operations
   - Review resource utilization
   - Implement recommended optimizations
   - Validate improvements

## Next Steps
