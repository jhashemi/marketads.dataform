# Mock Implementations: Compliance with Dataform Best Practices

This document outlines how our mock implementations for external dependencies comply with the Dataform best practices outlined in [DATAFORM_BEST_PRACTICES.md](./DATAFORM_BEST_PRACTICES.md).

## Alignment with Best Practices

### JavaScript Includes

Our mock implementations follow these best practices:

1. ✅ **Modular Design**: Each mock is focused on a specific functionality domain (`phonetic-algorithms` and `addresser`).
2. ✅ **Proper Exports**: All functions are exported using `module.exports`.
3. ✅ **Self-Contained**: Mocks are self-contained and don't have external dependencies.
4. ✅ **Documentation**: Functions include comments explaining their purpose and behavior.
5. ✅ **Error Handling**: Edge cases are handled gracefully.

### SQL Generation

The mock implementations generate SQL expressions rather than running JavaScript code, which aligns with these principles:

1. ✅ **SQL-First**: All operations are translated to SQL expressions.
2. ✅ **BigQuery Native**: Uses BigQuery's native functions like `SOUNDEX()` and `LEVENSHTEIN()`.
3. ✅ **Performance**: Leverages database optimizations rather than client-side processing.

### Integration

1. ✅ **Project Structure**: Mocks are placed in the appropriate `includes/mocks` directory.
2. ✅ **Import Patterns**: Updated import statements follow the recommended patterns.
3. ✅ **Testing**: Unit tests are updated to validate the mock implementations.

## Key Improvements

### 1. SQL Generation Over JavaScript Processing

Before:
```javascript
// Using JavaScript to calculate Soundex
const phonetic = require('phonetic-algorithms');
const soundexValue = phonetic.soundex(name);
// JavaScript result used in SQL
return `${column} = '${soundexValue}'`;
```

After:
```javascript
// Generating SQL expression
const phonetic = require('../includes/mocks/phonetic-algorithms');
return phonetic.soundex(column);
// Results in: "SOUNDEX(column_name)"
```

### 2. Testability

- Tests now validate the SQL generation patterns
- Integration tests ensure the generated SQL functions properly
- Mock implementations are decoupled from external dependencies

### 3. Maintainability

- Simplified dependency management
- Reduced risk of npm dependency issues
- Better alignment with Dataform's preferred approach

## Deviations and Trade-offs

1. **Functionality Limitations**: Some advanced features from original libraries may not be available in BigQuery's native functions.
2. **Performance**: While BigQuery functions are optimized for scale, the specific algorithmic implementations may differ slightly.
3. **Compatibility**: The SQL expressions may not behave identically to the original libraries in all edge cases.

## Conclusion

The mock implementations successfully:
- Replace external JavaScript libraries with SQL generation
- Maintain test compatibility
- Follow Dataform best practices
- Improve maintainability and reduce external dependencies

These changes ensure the codebase adheres to Dataform guidelines while preserving the core functionality required for matching operations.
