# Terminal Command Execution Rules

**Principle:** Always execute commands from the project's root directory. Avoid prepending commands with directory changes or other modifications.

- Run commands directly from the root.
- Use the exact command as intended.

## General Example

**BAD** (Modifies execution context):

```bash
<prefix> && <command>
```

**GOOD** (Runs command directly):

```bash
<command>
```

## Specific Example (pytest)

**BAD** (Changes directory before running pytest):

```bash
cd C:\Dev\AISDR\dialog_agent && python -m pytest -v tests/unit/models/test_sales_models.py
```

**GOOD** (Runs pytest from the root):

```bash
pytest -v tests/unit/models/test_sales_models.py
```

## Potential Issues

Modifying the execution context can cause:

- File not found errors.
- Incorrect imports.
- Relative path issues.
- Unexpected behavior.
